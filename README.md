This is my final project on Morocco. 

# Administrative Subdivisions of Morocco 2
![](Morocco.png)
This plot and chart demonstrate the district (adm2) boundaries of Morocco. Names of each province, are divided into green or blue blocks, with districts subdivided within each state as demonstrated by the thin, white lines. Morocco has 75 second-level administrative subdivisions with 13 prefectures and 62 provinces. 
The population density in Morocco within its regional boundaries is also shown. The highest densities are within the Casablanca region and Greater Accra â€“ the historical/cultural center and modern trading hub. In general, there is a higher density towards the southern part of the country as this is where Ghana borders the ocean. In the north lies the Saharah desert, a less habitable and more formidable climate to live in.
