This is my final project on Morocco. 

# Administrative Subdivisions of Morocco 2
![](Morocco.png)
This plot and chart demonstrate the district (adm2) boundaries of Morocco. Names of each province, are divided into green or blue blocks, with districts subdivided within each state as demonstrated by the thin, white lines. Morocco has 75 second-level administrative subdivisions with 13 prefectures and 62 provinces. 
The population density in Morocco within its regional boundaries is also shown. The highest densities are within the Casablanca region and Marrakech - Tensift - Al-Haouz region. Such regions are the conventional cultural hub of the nation, with a stable population of around 3.36 million. It is relatively less populated in the North, where Morocco borders with Algeria.
